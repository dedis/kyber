Dissent - Dining-Cryptographers, Shuffled-Send Network

Overview
===============================================================================
This library will eventually provide a framework for constructing provably
anonymous overlays with the following key features.

Contact
===============================================================================
TBA

Workflow
===============================================================================
More specifically, these are requirements that should be followed prior to
asking for a code review / pull.  A code review / pull in this sense refers to
the submission of a pull request not an academic discussion on design choices.

API expectations:
- Doxygen with comments
- Follows existing patterns in the code or accompanies patches that improve
  those interfaces

Internals:
- Minimizes dependencies, if A can work without knowing about B, A should not
  know about B, make a C that knows about both to handle interoperation
- Emphasize Qt features while minimizing additional dependencies on external
  libraries
- Avoid blocking calls

Commits:
- The comments should be clear and only code chunks relevant to the commit
  message should be included
- Merges should be rebased onto the current master and tested working before
  merging (git checkout -b merge master && git merge --squash dev)
- Incomplete work should not be committed nor merged

Also note, when you submit code for inclusion in this library, you implicitly
release your personal license to the software to Yale Dedis, see below.
