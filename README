Dissent Library and Applications for Provable Anonymous Communication

Overview
===============================================================================
This library will eventually provide a framework for constructing provably
anonymous overlays with the following key features.

The library requires Qt and CryptoPP and can be built using qmake on
dissent.pro (qmake -makefile dissent.pro)

While previous versions of the code focused on linkable libraries, because this
has unnecessary complexities, we plan to only support unified binaries.

Directory Structure
===============================================================================
ext - external sources required to build the code
src - source code for the development branch
legacy/libdissent - original, unmodified C++ version
legacy/py - original, unmodified Python version

Tests
===============================================================================
This suite contains many tests using googletest[1], use qmake on test.pro 
(qmake -makefile test.pro) to generate an appropriate makefile, which will
create a binary to test the code.

googletest was chosen because testing system code with QtTest would be quite
inefficient.
